# Runtime capacity (NOT-245)

Provider-neutral observed capacity for runtime accounts. Capacity belongs to
an authenticated runtime account, not an Agent profile: the Agents page and
`GET /api/runtime-capacity` report one entry per configured runtime, no matter
how many Agent profiles share it.

## Adapter interface

`packages/server/src/capacity/adapter.ts`. One adapter per provider surface:

```ts
interface CapacityAdapter {
  runtime: Runtime;
  source: "supported_protocol" | "observed_event" | "experimental_api";
  read(nowMs?: number): AdapterReadResult | Promise<AdapterReadResult>;
}
```

A read returns raw window readings plus unavailable readings:

- `AdapterWindowReading` — `windowKey` (stable per runtime, e.g.
  `weekly_all_models`), `providerBucket`, optional `durationMinutes`, the
  provider's own `providerLabel`, raw `usedValue`/`usedUnit`, and **one** used
  scale: `usedPercent` (0–100) or `usedFraction` (0–1). Optional `resetAt`,
  `observedAt`, `staleAfterMs`/`expiresAfterMs` overrides, and `evidenceRef`.
- `AdapterUnavailableReading` — same keys plus a machine-readable `reason`
  (`unsupported` | `missing` | `expired` | `unparsable` | `stale`).

Normalization (`normalizeAdapterWindow`) derives the snapshot:

- `displayLabel` from duration when defensible (300 min → `5H`,
  10,080 min → `1W`, ~30 d → `1M`, other exact hours/days → `NH`/`ND`);
  otherwise the provider label is kept verbatim — never guessed.
- `remainingPercent` as `clamp(100 - usedPercent, 0, 100)`; fractions are
  normalized to percent *before* the calculation. No usable scale →
  `unparsable`, `remainingPercent: null`.
- `freshUntil`/`expiresAt` default to observed + 15 min / + 60 min.

Provider live reads (auth, subprocess protocol) land in sibling tickets.
Until then, `fixtureMultiWindowAdapter` / `fixtureUnsupportedAdapter` /
`fixtureStaleAdapter` stand in deterministically.

## Freshness rules

| Condition | Rendered as |
|---|---|
| `remainingPercent` present, reset/expiry/freshness all future | remaining % |
| `resetAt` in the past (or unparsable reset) | N/A `expired` — a past reset is never current capacity |
| past `expiresAt` | N/A `expired` |
| past `freshUntil` but inside expiry | N/A `stale` |
| provider reports no surface | N/A `unsupported` |
| supported but nothing recorded yet | N/A `missing` |
| payload arrived but no usable scale | N/A `unparsable` |

Classification happens at read time in `capacity/service.ts`, so a snapshot
that ages out flips to N/A without a writer round-trip.

## API

`GET /api/runtime-capacity` → `RuntimeCapacityResponse`: every configured
runtime (distinct `agents.runtime` values plus any runtime holding snapshots),
its windows with freshness applied, and an explicit entry-level
`unavailableReason` when no window is current. Normalized snapshots only —
`evidence_ref` and raw provider payloads never leave the server.

## Persistence

`runtime_capacity_snapshots(runtime, window_key, …)` — one row per window, so
a provider can report several independently resetting windows per account.
Writes are per-window upserts; a partial re-observation never deletes a
still-valid sibling window. Independent of `runtime_availability` (NOT-111
hard caps): capacity snapshots neither read nor clear hard-cap rows, and
connection health stays a separate state — green health never implies known
capacity.
